# Water Metering in Smart Cities

**🎯 Objective**
The objective of this project is to detect abnormalities in water consumption and prevent water meter tampering or theft in smart city environments.

## 💧 Inductive Proximity Sensor

-   Utilized an **inductive proximity sensor** with edge-triggered interrupts for precise pulse counting.
-   The pulse signal is used to calculate the water flow rate accurately.
-   Measurement resolution: **0.5 liters**.
-   Designed for reliable real-time flow monitoring in residential or industrial water systems.


## 🔧 Inductive PCBA Sensor for Metering

-   Supports **bidirectional flow detection** (forward and reverse flow).
-   Implements **signal intensity monitoring** to detect sensor removal or tampering (anti-theft mechanism).
-   Uses **one-wire UART communication** between the sensor and the controller by dynamically configuring TX/RX roles.
-   Measurement resolution: **1 liter**.
-   Suitable for secure and intelligent water metering applications in smart infrastructure systems.
